Cumulative number of reported suspect and probable cases (SARS)


General notes (present in one form or another in many tables):
1. Cumulative number of cases includes number of deaths.	
2. It is possible for the status of a reported case to change over time. SARS is a diagnosis of exclusion. This means that whenever a known cause is found that could fully account for a patient's clinical condition, this patient should no longer be considered to be a case of SARS.
3. Starting on 28 March 2003, the following change occurs: "The start of the period of surveillance has been changed to 1 November 2002 to capture cases of atypical pneumonia in China that are now recognized as being cases of SARS".

Cumulative number of cases includes number of deaths. 

As SARS is a diagnosis of exclusion, the status of a reported case may change over time. This means that previously reported cases may be discarded after further investigation and follow-up.

2. A decrease in the number of cumulative cases and discrepancies in the difference between cumulative number of cases of the last and the current WHO update are attributed to the discarding of cases.
3. Includes cases who are "discharged" or "recovered" as reported by the national public health authorities.
